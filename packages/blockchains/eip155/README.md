# EVM Compatible Blockchain Provider 
This package is part of [IQ Protocol JS SDK.](https://github.com/iqalliance/iq-sdk-js)

The package includes [Blockchain Provider Interface](https://github.com/iqalliance/iq-sdk-js/tree/main/packages/abstract-blockchain) implementation which allows interacting with IQ Protocol smart contracts deployed to EVM powered blockchain.  
Whereas there are many [EVM powered blockchains](https://chainlist.org/), IQ protocol smart contracts can be deployed to any EVM-compatible blockchain and this package can be used to interact with them.

The package name comes from [EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) which was the first adopted proposal which allowed to uniquely identify EVM-compatible blockchains and networks.
         
## Installation  
```bash
yarn add @iqprotocol/eip155
```
